Push [[Phoenix]] to rubble
Dont need to use [[Kayo]] util just watch /break other util for phoenix, could also flash past the wall 
[[Gekko]] flash straight up immediately (double flash with phoenix should get everyone)

Need to help phoenix for 10 seconds so gecko can get flash back

## [[A rubble trap]] || tldr

off [[Gekko]] contact double flash and swing

## [[Viper C reactions-midrounds]] || tldr

[[Kayo]] knife for info in B or on door in C for info

If pushing fast C let viper stall with orb and molly initially, then [[Kayo]] knife the door to stall for longer, after viper and kayo should have harbor wall again.

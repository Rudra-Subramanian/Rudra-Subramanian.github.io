# Cypher A

[[High Pressure Defaults]]

### Side : [[Defence]]

When Expect early presence/fast push from opponent to take main control early. They use the initial util we thought they would +  we make them use more util after to reclear it if they want or lose time

[[Sova]] can dart on retake

If get no contact B main [[Cypher]] pop mid cam for info if no mid [[Jett]] and [[Sova]] can push out B
If heavy A [[Jett]] [[Sova]] should threaten mid

This set up should let them give us early garage control then use util to reclear it

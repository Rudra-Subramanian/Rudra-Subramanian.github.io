# Viper A default


### Side : [[Defence]]

## Start of round default
[[Phoenix]] and [[Kayo]] can change sides if we feel like they are playing slow and want more info on C

**_[[Phoenix]] does not have to play there, they can play anywhere on site to stop a hit_**

other options for viper orbs (just ideas):

## If we hear C we do [[C Mound trap]] || tldr
[[Kayo]]/[[Phoenix]] throw molly behind mound (could be off wall)
[[Gekko]] flash from C connector
[[Kayo]]/[[Phoenix]] flash from main and swing with [[Harbor]]


## [[Viper A reactions-midrounds]] || tldr

If [[Gekko]] leans C for flash Kayo  can watch B from up, [[Viper]] watches long

Otherwise try to push opponents into mound trap or fighting onto A with 2 people and potential flood

Can also flank out of C for quick flank when they are taking site
